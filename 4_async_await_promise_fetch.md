# Understanding Async/Await and Promises in React

This guide is a detailed walkthrough of how asynchronous JavaScript works in a React environment. We'll use the provided example code and explain every concept for beginners, including visuals and examples.

---

## 1️⃣ The Async Function

### Code Snippet
```javascript
export const asyncjs = async () => {
  return "working...";
};
````

### Explanation

* **`async` keyword**: Marks the function as asynchronous, which means it always returns a **Promise**.
* **Return value**: Even though we return a string (`"working..."`), because the function is `async`, it actually returns a **Promise that resolves to that string**.

### Visual Representation

```
asyncjs() --> Promise {
  <resolved>: "working..."
}
```

* `asyncjs()` doesn't immediately give "working...", it gives a **Promise**. You need `.then()` or `await` to access the resolved value.

---

## 2️⃣ Using Async Function in React Component

### Code Snippet

```javascript
import React, { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import { asyncjs } from "../test/async.js";

export default function Home() {
  const [val, setVal] = useState("");
  let str = "";

  console.log("from async: ");

  asyncjs().then((result) => {
    str = result;
  });
  console.log(str);
}
```

### Key Points

1. **`useState`**: Allows React to remember a value between renders. Here, `val` starts as an empty string `""`.
2. **`console.log(str)`**: Outputs an empty string because **Promises are asynchronous**. `console.log` runs before the Promise resolves.

### Visual Timeline

```
Execution Context:
1. let str = "";
2. console.log(str) -> ""
3. asyncjs().then(...) schedules callback for later
4. JS continues
5. Promise resolves, callback runs: str = "working..."
```

So the first `console.log(str)` is empty because the Promise hasn't resolved yet.

---

## 3️⃣ Correct Way: Using `useEffect`

### Code Snippet

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  asyncjs().then((res) => {
    setVal(res);
  });
}, []);
```

### Explanation

* **`useEffect`**: React hook that runs side-effects after rendering.
* **Empty dependency array `[]`**: Ensures this runs only **once**, similar to `componentDidMount`.
* **`setVal(res)`**: Updates the state with the resolved value. This triggers a re-render.

### Why use `useEffect`?

* Calling async function directly in JSX is not allowed because JSX **cannot render a Promise**.
* `useEffect` ensures async operations run **after the component has mounted**.

### Visual Flow

```
Render 1:
- val = "" -> <h1>{val}</h1> shows nothing
- useEffect triggers asyncjs().then(...) -> sets val = "working..."
Render 2 (after setVal):
- val = "working..." -> <h1>{val}</h1> now shows "working..."
```

---

## 4️⃣ JSX Rendering of Async Values

### Incorrect Approach

```javascript
<h1>{asyncjs().then(res => setVal(res))}</h1>
```

* Problem: JSX **cannot render a Promise**.
* The `then` call schedules an update but returns `undefined` to JSX, which React cannot display.

### Correct Approach

```javascript
<h1>{val}</h1>
```

* Render the **state value** instead, which is updated asynchronously.

## 5️⃣ Key Concepts for Beginners

| Concept        | Explanation                    | Example                                                  |
| -------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Async function | Returns a Promise              | `async function f() { return 5; }` -> returns Promise<5> |
| Promise        | Represents future value        | `asyncjs().then(res => console.log(res))`                |
| .then()        | Callback when promise resolves | `asyncjs().then(res => setVal(res))`                     |
| useState       | React state hook               | `const [val, setVal] = useState("")`                     |
| useEffect      | Runs side effects after render | `useEffect(() => {...}, [])`                             |

### Timeline Diagram

```
1️⃣ Component renders
2️⃣ val = "" -> shows empty <h1>
3️⃣ useEffect triggers async call
4️⃣ asyncjs() resolves -> setVal("working...")
5️⃣ React re-renders -> val = "working..." -> <h1>working...</h1>
```

---

## 6️⃣ Complete Working Code

```javascript
import React, { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import { asyncjs } from "../test/async.js";

export default function Home() {
  const [val, setVal] = useState("");

  useEffect(() => {
    asyncjs().then((res) => {
      setVal(res);
    });
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>I am working...</h1>
      <h1>{val}</h1>
    </div>
  );
}
```

✅ This ensures:

* No direct async calls in JSX
* Proper state update
* Proper rendering after Promise resolves

---

## 7️⃣ Bonus: Using `await` inside `useEffect`

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  const fetchData = async () => {
    const result = await asyncjs();
    setVal(result);
  };

  fetchData();
}, []);
```

* `await` pauses execution until Promise resolves
* Must wrap inside another async function because `useEffect` callback **cannot be async directly**

---

## Summary

* **Async functions** always return Promises.
* **Promises** need `.then()` or `await` to access resolved values.
* **React state** (`useState`) is used to store async results.
* **useEffect** is the right place to handle async operations in components.
* **Never call async directly in JSX**.

This covers **everything a beginner needs to fully understand async in React**.


## In my terms
```javascript
import React, { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import { asyncjs } from "../test/async.js";
export default function Home() {
  const [val, setVal] = useState("");
  let str = "";
  console.log("from async: ");
  //asyncjs is a function that retunes the promise
  //now we need to resolve it using .then or await
  //.then takes a callback that takes a value(result in this case) and filled with the response value (working... in this case)
  asyncjs().then((result) => {
    str = result;
  });
  console.log(str); //str is empty As the clg runs before the data gets fetched even though it is written before, it gets in execution context after clg so use it after useEffect

  useEffect(() => {
    asyncjs().then((res) => {
      setVal(res);
    });
  }, []);
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>I am working...</h1>
      {/* dont call directly async function inside bcz jsx dont know how to render promise */}
      {/* {asyncjs().then((res) => {
        setVal(res);
      })} */}
      <h1>{val}</h1>
    </div>
  );
}
```

# Understanding Promises, Async/Await, and JavaScript Execution

This guide explains JavaScript promises, async/await behavior, and execution order with detailed examples and comments. It’s suitable for beginners to fully understand how JS handles asynchronous code.

---

## 1️⃣ Normal Promise
```javascript
export const fun = () => {
  console.log("i am working fine");

  // Create a new promise
  const p = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    resolve("Promise resolved!"); // immediately resolves
  });

  function getData() {
    // .then() is used to handle resolved value of promise
    p.then((res) => console.log(res));
  }

  getData();
};
````

**Explanation:**

* JS engine executes code line by line.
* `p.then()` schedules the callback to run after current execution.
* Output:

```
i am working fine
Promise resolved!
```

* **Comment:** Promise does not block code execution, `.then()` runs asynchronously.

---

## 2️⃣ Promise with setTimeout

```javascript
export const fun = () => {
  const p = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      resolve("Promise resolved!");
    }, 3000);
  });

  function getData() {
    console.log("one");
    p.then((res) => console.log(res));
    console.log("two");
  }

  // output: one, two, Promise resolved
  getData();
};
```

**Explanation:**

* `setTimeout` delays resolution of the promise.
* JS engine **does not wait** for promise, executes next line immediately.
* Output after 3 seconds: `Promise resolved!`
* **Comment:** Promise callbacks are asynchronous and run after current execution context finishes.

---

## 3️⃣ Using Await

```javascript
const p = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    resolve("Promise resolved!");
  }, 3000);
});

async function handlePromise() {
  console.log("one");
  const val = await p; // JS waits here until promise resolves
  console.log(val);
  console.log("two");
}

handlePromise();
```

**Explanation:**

* `await` **pauses the async function** until the promise resolves.
* JS engine does not block other tasks globally, but inside async function it waits.
* Output after 3 seconds:

```
one
Promise resolved!
two
```

* **Comment:** Await gives sequential-like behavior for async operations.

---

## 4️⃣ Multiple Await Calls

```javascript
export const fun = () => {
  const p = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      resolve("Promise resolved!");
    }, 3000);
  });

  async function handlePromise() {
    console.log("one");
    const val = await p;
    console.log(val);
    console.log("two");
    const val2 = await p;
    console.log(val2);
    console.log("three");
  }

  handlePromise();

  // output: one, Promise resolved, two, Promise resolved, three
};
```

**Explanation:**

* Each `await` waits for the **same promise** (already resolved) but does not wait extra time.
* **Important Comment:** If you use multiple new promises with setTimeout, the timers run **concurrently**, not sequentially.
* So if each promise has 3s timeout, two promises can resolve around 3s each, not 6s total.

---

## 5️⃣ Multiple setTimeout with .then

```javascript
function getData() {
  console.log("one");
  p.then((res) => console.log(res));
  console.log("two");
  p.then((res) => console.log(res));
  console.log("three");
}

// output: one, two, three, Promise resolved, Promise resolved
getData();
```

**Explanation:**

* `.then()` callbacks are asynchronous.
* JS executes all synchronous code first: `console.log("one")`, `console.log("two")`, `console.log("three")`
* When promise resolves, the `.then()` callbacks run.
* **Comment:** Promises do not block execution; each `.then()` is independent and queued for execution after current stack.

---

## ✅ Key Takeaways

* **Promises**: Do not block execution. `.then()` runs asynchronously.
* **setTimeout**: Delays resolution but does not pause JS execution.
* **await**: Pauses async function until promise resolves, providing sequential-like code.
* **Multiple timers**: Run concurrently, not sequentially. Total wait is max timer, not sum.
* **.then() vs await**: `.then()` schedules callback asynchronously; `await` pauses execution inside async function.
* **Comment Emphasis:** Understanding event loop and execution order is crucial for async


# Understanding Async, Await, and Promise Execution in JavaScript

This guide explains how JavaScript handles **Promises**, **async/await**, **fetch**, and **error handling** with complete inline explanations and comments preserved.

---

## 🧩 Example 1: Sequential Promise Execution Using Async/Await

```javascript
const p = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    resolve("Promise resolved!");
  }, 3000);
});

const p2 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    resolve("Promise resolved2 !");
  }, 3000);
});

async function handlePromise() {
  console.log("one");
  const val = await p; // waits till 'p' is resolved before moving forward
  console.log(val);
  console.log("two");
  const val2 = await p2; // waits till 'p2' is resolved after 'p' completes
  console.log(val2);
  console.log("three");
}

handlePromise();

// Output -> one, Promise resolved (after 3 sec), two, Promise resolved2, three
```

---

## ⚡ Example 2: Parallel Promise Execution Using .then()

```javascript
const p = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    resolve("Promise resolved!");
  }, 3000);
});

const p2 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    resolve("Promise resolved2 !");
  }, 3000);
});

// async function handlePromise() {
//   console.log("one");
//   const val = await p;
//   console.log(val);
//   console.log("two");
//   const val2 = await p2;
//   console.log(val2);
//   console.log("three");
// }
// handlePromise();

// Output -> one, Promise resolved (after 3 sec), two, Promise resolved2, three

function getData() {
  console.log("one");
  p.then((res) => console.log(res)); // Executes asynchronously
  console.log("two");
  p2.then((res) => console.log(res)); // Executes asynchronously
  console.log("three");
}

// Output: one, two, three, Promise resolved, Promise resolved2 (both after 3 seconds — not sequential)
getData();
```

📘 **Key Takeaway:**

* Using `.then()` executes both promises **in parallel** — both timers start together.
* Using `await` executes them **sequentially** — one after another.

---

## 🕰️ Example 3: Different Timer Durations

```javascript
const p = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    resolve("Promise resolved!");
  }, 10000);
});

const p2 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    resolve("Promise resolved2 !");
  }, 5000);
});

async function handlePromise() {
  console.log("one");
  const val = await p; // waits 10 sec
  console.log(val);
  console.log("two");
  const val2 = await p2; // already resolved after 5 sec, so executes immediately
  console.log(val2);
  console.log("three");
}

handlePromise();

// Output -> one, (after 10 sec) Promise resolved, two, Promise resolved2, three
```

---

## ⚙️ Deep Dive: Execution Context Working

### Step-by-step:

1. **First log executes immediately**

   * `console.log("one")` is pushed into execution context and printed.

2. **Encountering `await p`**

   * Since the promise is not resolved yet, JS **suspends** the async function’s execution.
   * The function moves **out of the call stack**, freeing the main thread.
   * This ensures the page doesn’t freeze while waiting.

3. **Promise Timer Execution**

   * The `setTimeout` inside the Promise runs **in parallel** (in the browser's Web API environment).
   * After 10 seconds, the callback queue pushes the resolved promise result back.

4. **Resuming Execution**

   * Once the promise resolves, the async function is **brought back into execution context**.
   * The function continues from where it was suspended.

5. **`await p2` behaves similarly**, but since `p2` had already resolved (after 5 sec), it executes instantly.

> ❓ **Why timers run in parallel and not sequentially?**
>
> Because JavaScript’s event loop doesn’t block on promises. Both `setTimeout`s start simultaneously in the Web API. While `await` suspends only the **current async function**, the timers continue counting independently.

🧠 **Key Insight:**

* JavaScript engine never waits for a promise to resolve.
* It simply **pauses** (suspends) execution of the async function, allowing the main thread to process other tasks.

---

## 🌐 Example 4: Fetch and Async/Await

```javascript
export const fun = () => {
  async function handlePromise() {
    const API_URL = "https://api.github.com/users/antim-revapati25";

    // how fetch works

    // fetch(API_URL); --> fetch returns a promise
    // await fetch(API_URL); we use await to resolve promise which will return a response object

    const data = await fetch(API_URL); // gives response obj which has readable stream

    // we need to convert data to json which will also return a promise
    // data.json() will return a promise, and once this promise resolves, it gives the JSON value

    const jsonVal = await data.json();

    // alternative using .then
    // fetch(API_URL)
    //   .then((data) => data.json())
    //   .then((res) => console.log(res));

    console.log(jsonVal);
  }
  handlePromise();
};
```

📘 **Flow:**

1. `fetch()` returns a Promise.
2. `await fetch()` resolves it and gives a `Response` object.
3. `response.json()` returns another Promise.
4. The final JSON is obtained after resolving that Promise.

---

## 🚨 Example 5: Error Handling in Async/Await

```javascript
export const fun = () => {
  async function handlePromise() {
    const API_URL = "https://api.github.com/users/antim-revapati25";

    // error handling is done using try catch in async await
    try {
      const data = await fetch(API_URL); // gives response obj which has readable stream

      const jsonVal = await data.json();
      console.log(jsonVal);
    } catch (err) {
      console.log("failed to fetch the data: " + err);
    }

    // alternative using .then
    // fetch(API_URL)
    //   .then((data) => data.json())
    //   .then((res) => console.log(res));
    // error handling in .then is done using .catch method
  }
  handlePromise();
};
```

✅ **Key Concept:**

* Use `try...catch` to handle errors in async/await syntax.
* In `.then()`, use `.catch()` for error handling.

---

## ⚙️ Example 6: Handling Errors via Promise Catch

```javascript
export const fun = () => {
  async function handlePromise() {
    const API_URL = "https://api.github.com/users/antim-revapati25";

    const data = await fetch(API_URL); // gives response obj which has readable stream

    const jsonVal = await data.json();
    console.log(jsonVal);
  }

  // async function returns a promise, so we can catch errors like this also
  handlePromise().catch((err) => console.log("failed to fetch: " + err));
};
```

🧠 **Insight:**

* Async functions always return a **Promise**.
* Hence, you can attach `.catch()` to handle rejections directly.

| `fetch()`                     | Returns a Promise             | Must resolve twice: for `fetch()` and for `response.json()` |
| `try...catch`                 | Handles errors in async/await | Cleaner than `.catch()` chaining                            |
| `setTimeout()` inside Promise | Runs in Web APIs              | Executes asynchronously without blocking main thread        |

---

## 🧠 Core Concept Recap

> JavaScript is **single-threaded**, but with **event loop**, **callback queue**, and **Web APIs**, it achieves **asynchronous behavior** without blocking.
>
> Async/Await makes this easier to read and manage, but under the hood, it’s still promise-based asynchronous execution.
