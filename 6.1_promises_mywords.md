// promise.all --> we pass iterable (array) or promises
// promise.all will have the value of result of all the promises in a array/iterable form
// Promise.all([p1,p2,p3]) now suppose p1=2s, p2=3s, p3=1s {p takes x sec to complete} then the final output will be the max time, so result will come after 3 seconds.

// but after 1 sec p3 got failed then as soon as any promise gets failed, promise.all will return error. result will not wait for the output of other promises, (the rest of the promises cannot be cancelled as they got fired, but there result does not matter now)

// promise.all ==> all or none, also known as fail fast

// --------------------------------------

// promise.allSetteled([p1,p2,p3]) -> times 3s, 1s, 2s
// p1,p2,p3 got success then we will get result after 3s
// if p2(1s) got rejected then promise.allSetteled will wait for all promises to get settled (resolved or rejected doesn't matter, as this is settled state). and the output will have the values of each promise, wheather it is success or error

// ----------------------------------------

// promise.race([p1,p2,p3]) --> time 3s, 5s, 2s
// as soon as the first promise settled, it will retuned the value of that promise only, in this case: p3 got settled first so it will be returned.
// if the first setteled promise is error then error will be thrown

// promise.race --> return any first settled promise-> suceess or failure
// ------------------------
// Promise.any([p1,p2,p3]) --> times 3s, 1s, 2s
// it will wait for first promise to get resolved (not settled), means success
// in this case it will return p2 if it is resolves/success
// if p2 gets error/rejected then promise.any will wait for next success promise and return that value  
// if every promise got failed then returned result will be aggregated error containing errors of all promises

// promise.any --> return first success/resolved case only
